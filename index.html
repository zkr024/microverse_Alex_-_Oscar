        <p>Unlike any known aircraft, these objects have been sighted overcoming the earth’s 
          gravity with no visible means of propulsion.</p>
        <p>They also lack any flight surfaces, such as wings. In the Nimitz incident, witnesses 
          describe the crafts as tubular, shaped like a Tic Tac candy.</p>

        <p>The objects may accelerate or change direction so quickly that no human pilot could 
          survive the g-forces—they would be crushed. In the Nimitz incident, radar operators 
          say they tracked one of the UFOs as it dropped from the sky at more than 30 times the 
          speed of sound.</p>
        <p>Black Aces squadron commander David Fravor, the Nimitz-based fighter pilot who was 
          sent to intercept one of the objects, likened its rapid side-to-side movements, later 
          captured on infrared video, to that of a ping-pong ball.</p>

          If an aircraft travels faster than the speed of sound, 
          it typically leaves "signatures," like vapor trails and 
          sonic booms. Many UFO accounts note the lack of such evidence.

        <p>
          Even when objects are observed, getting a clear and detailed 
          view of them—either through pilot sightings, radar or other 
          means—remains difficult. Witnesses generally only see the 
          glow or haze around them.

        <p>
          Some UAP have been seen moving easily in and between different 
          environments, such as space, the earth’s atmosphere and even water.
        </p> 
        <p>
          In the Nimitz incident, witnesses described a UFO hovering over
          a churning "disturbance" just under the ocean's otherwise calm surface, 
          leading to speculation that another craft had entered the water.
        </p>
        <p>
          USS Princeton radar operator Gary Vorhees later confirmed 
          from a Navy sonar operator in the area that day that a craft 
          was moving faster than 70 knots, roughly two times the speed 
          of nuclear subs.
        </p>
        <p>No one has yet gotten close to crafts that display these 
          traits, so their origins are still unknown. Are they a super-top-secret 
          U.S. defense project? Do they hail from Russia? China? Or from even 
          further afield? The only thing we do know is that their capabilities 
          exceed any technologies currently in the U.S. arsenal.
