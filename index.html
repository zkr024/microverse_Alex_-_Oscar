          <p>Unlike any known aircraft, these objects have been sighted overcoming the earth’s 
          gravity with no visible means of propulsion.</p>
          <p>They also lack any flight surfaces, such as wings. In the Nimitz incident, witnesses 
          describe the crafts as tubular, shaped like a Tic Tac candy.</p>

          <li>Calculating acceleration</li>
          <li>Instantaneous Acceleration</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We describe it with this simple equation: <br>
          <br><code> L = Cl * A * .5 * r * V^2 </code><br>
          <br><b>L</b> is equal to the lift coefficient <b>Cl</b> times the density <b>r</b> times half of the velocity <b>V</b> squared times the wing area <b>A</b>
        </p>

          <p>The objects may accelerate or change direction so quickly that no human pilot could 
          survive the g-forces—they would be crushed. In the Nimitz incident, radar operators 
          say they tracked one of the UFOs as it dropped from the sky at more than 30 times the 
          speed of sound.</p>
          <p>Black Aces squadron commander David Fravor, the Nimitz-based fighter pilot who was 
          sent to intercept one of the objects, likened its rapid side-to-side movements, later 
          captured on infrared video, to that of a ping-pong ball.</p>
          <p>Radar operators on the USS Princeton, part of the Nimitz carrier group, tracked the 
          object accelerating from a standing position to traveling 60 miles in a minute—an 
          astounding 3,600 miles an hour</p>

          <p>If an aircraft travels faster than the speed of sound, it typically leaves "signatures," 
          like vapor trails and sonic booms. Many UFO accounts note the lack of such evidence. </p>

          <p>Even when objects are observed, getting a clear and detailed view of them—either through 
          pilot sightings, radar or other means—remains difficult. Witnesses generally only see the 
          glow or haze around them.</p>

        <p>Some UAP have been seen moving easily in and between different environments, such as space, 
          the earth’s atmosphere and even water.</p>
        <p>In the Nimitz incident, witnesses described a UFO hovering over a churning "disturbance" just 
          under the ocean's otherwise calm surface, leading to speculation that another craft had entered 
          the water.</p>
        <p>USS Princeton radar operator Gary Vorhees later confirmed from a Navy sonar operator in the area 
          that day that a craft was moving faster than 70 knots, roughly two times the speed of nuclear subs.</p>
